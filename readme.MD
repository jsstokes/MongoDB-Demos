# MongoDB
<!-- What does your company do? What makes you interesting? Why should a team use your tech? Enter text below: -->
MongoDB is the leading modern, general purpose database platform, designed to unleash the power of software and data for developers and the applications they build. MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need. With products like MongoDB Atlas & MongoDB Stitch you can spend more time building apps than managing databases. 
# Challenge Info
<!-- What are you looking for? How will teams be judged? Enter text below:  -->
We're looking for the best and most innovative application of MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Stitch. Teams will be judged by the tech they produce and the creativity of the application built.

[Xbox One X Robot White (1TB)](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/consoles/xbox-one-x/fallout-76-1tb-se)

# Getting Started
<!-- How do teams use your tech? Do you have links to resources? Are there directories here that include sample projects? Enter text below: -->
The absolute easiest path to using MongoDB is to utilize **Atlas** - our *Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)* offering. Using **Atlas**, you can directly access MongoDB Atlas database from you web pages using Javascript - without the need for an intermediate Web Service or microservice by using our [QueryAnywhere](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/getting-started/configure-rules-based-access-to-mongodb/) Javascript SDK.  Using **MongoDB Atlass** also allows you to leverage [MongoDB Stitch](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/), our serverless, *Backend-as-a-Service*.
