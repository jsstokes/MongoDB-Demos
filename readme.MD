MongoDB is the leading modern, general purpose database platform, designed to unleash the power of software and data for developers and the applications they build. MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need. With products like MongoDB Atlas & MongoDB Stitch you can spend more time building apps than managing databases.
# Challenge Info

One of the core tenets of MongoDB is the ability to run anywhere.  This means you can run MongoDB in a wide variety of places: on your local machine, in your datacenter, in the cloud, and even on your mobile device!

## MongoDB Atlas (DBaaS available on Azure, AWS, or GCP)
The absolute easiest path to using MongoDB is to utilize **MongoDB Atlas** - our *Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)* offering. We offer a truly free tier for **MongoDB Atlas** - and we don't even require a credit card.  Using **Atlas**, you can directly access MongoDB Atlas database from you web pages using Javascript - without the need for an intermediate Web Service or microservice by using our [QueryAnywhere](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/getting-started/configure-rules-based-access-to-mongodb/) Javascript SDK.  Using **MongoDB Atlass** also allows you to leverage [MongoDB Stitch](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/), our serverless, *Backend-as-a-Service*.

## On Your Local Machine
If you choose to run MongoDB on your local machine, you will need to download and install MongoDB.  While this has historically been the most common method, there are several considrations when choosing this path:
* security policies on your laptop may prevent software from being installed
* firewalls on you local machine may block the port used my MongoDB (*default port is 27017*)
* hardware characteristics of your machine (*such as amount of RAM and available HD space*) may impose issues

# More About Us
<!-- Optional: Anything else you want to say! Enter text below: -->
MongoDB was founded in 2007 by Dwight Merriman, Eliot Horowitz and Kevin Ryan – the team behind DoubleClick.

At the Internet advertising company DoubleClick (now owned by Google), the team developed and used many custom data stores to work around the shortcomings of existing databases. The business served 400,000 ads per second, but often struggled with both scalability and agility. Frustrated, the team was inspired to create a database that tackled the challenges it faced at DoubleClick.

MongoDB is the leading modern, general purpose database platform, designed to unleash the power of software and data for developers and the applications they build. Headquartered in New York, with offices across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, we are close to where you do business. MongoDB has more than 13,000 customers in more than 100 countries. The MongoDB database platform has been downloaded over 60 million times and there have been more than 1 million MongoDB University registrations.

## Our Mission: To free the genius within everyone by making data ridiculously easy to work with
