This tutorial walks you through the steps of creating your own free tier MongoDB Atlas cluster, introduces you to the stitch application web based GUI and shows you how to create your first application.  This tutorial provides a great deal of information to help you get started, and does so in an easy way in about 15 minutes.

### MongoDB Stitch Application Hosting
Once you have created your first application you are ready to now host it for the world to see! Read the [hosting documentaion](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/hosting/) to get started. Its a two step process to [enable hosting](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/hosting/enable-hosting/) and then [upload content](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/hosting/upload-content-to-stitch/)
