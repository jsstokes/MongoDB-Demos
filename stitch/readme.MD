The MongoDB Stitch serverless platform makes it easy to build modern, cross-platform applications on top of MongoDB. Stitch removes the need for tedious boilerplate and automatically manages your app’s backend so you can focus on building what matters.

### Stitch QueryAnywhere

Exposes the full power of working with documents in MongoDB and the MongoDB query language, directly from your web and mobile application frontend code. A powerful rules engine lets developers declare fine-grained security policies.
